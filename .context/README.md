# Project Context Template

This folder is a drop-in starter for the context system (state, decisions, docs, personality). To use:

1) Copy this folder into your repo and rename it to `.context` (or any private name you prefer).
2) Fill out `PROJECT_STATE.md` with current goals/assumptions.
3) Append notable choices to `DECISIONS_LOG.md`.
4) List commands/how-to in `DOCUMENTS.md`.
5) Adjust `personality.md` if you want a different tone.

Keep this folder out of student-facing handouts unless you intend to share it. It can live one level above the student repo if desired.***
